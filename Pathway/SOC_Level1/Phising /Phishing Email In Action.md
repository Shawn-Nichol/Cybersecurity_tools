Tracking pixel is embedded in the email, usually hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company's server. 

Google served all images in Gmail through its own proxy servers, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. and extensions such as Ugly email and Pixel Block have been developed to block trackers on chrome and firefox
