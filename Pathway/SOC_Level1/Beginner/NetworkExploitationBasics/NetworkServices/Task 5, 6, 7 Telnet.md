## Enumerating Telnet
port scanning

Question: How many ports are open on the target machine?
nmap 10.10.122.187 will return zero results. This is because Nmap, by default, only scans the first 1000 ports. 
nmap -p- 10.10.122.187 This scan will work but will take an extended time. 
nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.10.225.219
