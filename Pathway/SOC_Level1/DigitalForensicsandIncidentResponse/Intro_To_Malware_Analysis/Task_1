Task 2
Malware analysis is performed by the following people. 
Security operations: 
Incident Response: 
Threat Hunt: 
Malware Researchers
Threat Research: 

Take the following precautions while analyzing malware
- Never analyze malware or suspected malware on a machine that does not have the sole purpose of analyzing malware. 
- When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, always keep them in password-protected zip/rar or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.
- Only extract the malware from this password-protected archive inside the isolated environment, and only when analyzing it
- Create an isolated VM specifically for malware analysis, which can be reverted to a clean slate once you are done. 
- Ensure that all internet connections are closed or at least monitored
- Once you're done with malware analysis, revert the VM to its clean slate for the next malware analysis session to avoid residue from a previous malware execution corrupting the next one.
