Task 2
Malware analysis is performed by the following people. 
Security operations: 
Incident Response: 
Threat Hunt: 
Malware Researchers
Threat Research: 

Take the following precautions while analyzing malware
- Never analyze malware or suspected malware on a machine that does not have the sole purpose of analyzing malware. 
- When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, always keep them in password-protected zip/rar or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.
- Only extract the malware from this password-protected archive inside the isolated environment, and only when analyzing it
- Create an isolated VM specifically for malware analysis, which can be reverted to a clean slate once you are done. 
- Ensure that all internet connections are closed or at least monitored
- Once you're done with malware analysis, revert the VM to its clean slate for the next malware analysis session to avoid residue from a previous malware execution corrupting the next one. 

Question 1: Which team uses malware analysis to look for IOCs and hunt for malware in a network?

Answer: Threat Hunt team

Task 3
- Executable file, also called a binary or PE(Portable Executable).


Static Analysis
When malware is analyzed without being executed, it is called static Analysis. In this case, the different properties of the PE file are analyzed without running it.
Ex checking for strings, checking PE header for information related to different sections, or dissembling code. 

Dynamic Analysis
Running malware to detect it. 
Run the malware in a VM, either in a manual fashion with tools installed to monitor the malware's activity or in the form of sandboxes that perform this task automatically. 

Advanced Malware Analysis
are used to analyze malware that evades basic static and dynamic analysis. For performing advanced malware analysis, disassemblers and debuggers are used. 
Disassemblers convert the malware's code from binary to assembly so that an analyst can look at the instructions of the malware statically. 
Debuggers attach to a program and allow the analyst to monitor the instructions in malware while it is running. A debugger allows the analyst to stop and run the malware at different points to identify interesting pieces of information while also providing an overview of the memory and CPU of the system. 


Question 1: Which technique is used for analyzing malware without executing it?
See notes above. 

Answer: Static Analysis

Question 2: Which technique is used for analyzing malware by executing it and observing its behavior in a controlled environment?
See notes above. 
Answer Dynamic Analysis


Task 4 Basic Static Analysis
The first step is to perform basic static analysis; this can be considered sizing up the malware, trying to find its properties before diving deep into the analysis. 

Examine file type. 
- file: The command can be used to understand what the file does. 
- Strings: The command will list the present strings in a file. 

Calculating Hashes

Question 1: In the attached VM, there is a sample named 'redline' in the Desktop/Samples directory. What is the md5sum of this sample?
