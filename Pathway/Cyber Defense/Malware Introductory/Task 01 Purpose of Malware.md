When analyzing malware, it is important to consider the following.
- Point of Entry (PoE): Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed, and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention.
- What indicators indicate malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or attempts of unordinary communication?
- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor/Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- Most importantly: can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?
