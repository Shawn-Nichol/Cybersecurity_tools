Much like any interaction with an OS, there are always remnants of such activity, even if there is little trace. 

Malware is largely obtrusive because it leaves quite an extensive paper trail of evidence. 

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps
1. Delivery
2. Execution
3. Maintaining persistence
4. Propagation

# Delivery
This could be many methods,
- USB (Stuxnet)
- PDF attachments through phishing

# Execution
What does it do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware. If it records information like keystrokes or displays adware, we can classify it as Spyware. 

# Maintaining Persistence


# Persistence
Ability  to maintain a connection

# Propagation
Ability to infect other-like devices.
