Much like an y interaction with an OS, there is always remnants of such activity even if there is little trace. 

Malware is largely obtrusive in the sense that it leaves quite an extensive papertrail of evidence. 

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broek down into a few broad steps
1. Delivery
2. Execution
3. Maintaining persistence
4. Propagation

# Delivery

- PDF attachments through phishing

# Execution
What does it do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware. If it records information likke keystrokes or displays adware we can classify it as Spyware. 

# Maintaining Persistence


# Persistence
Ability  to maintain connection

# Propagation
Ability to infect other like devices.
