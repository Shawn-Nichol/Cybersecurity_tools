## Creeper
The creeper program was the first-ever virus to be created. The program used ARPaanet to transfer itself between computers. Creeper was created in the programming language PDP-10 Assembly, which ran on the OS TENEX. 

## ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)
Started with two specific protocols: Remote login and transferring files. After their project was denied, the team working on it decided to design a program formally called the Network Control Program without all the unnecessary details; this was the start of computers being able to communicate within networks. 

Packet switching is breaking data into packets to then route or send said data to the receiver. The receiver will then reassemble the packets back into whatever data/file was being sent.
