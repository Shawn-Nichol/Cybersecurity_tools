## Task 6 Group Policies
GPO Group Policy Objects are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. GPOs can contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities. 

GPO will apply to the linked OU and any subOUs under it. 

The first tab you see when selecting a GPO is scope, which is where the GPO is linked in the AD. </br>

You can also apply Security Filtering to GPOs so that  they are only applied to specific users/computers under an OU. By default, they will apply to the Authenticated Users group, which includes all users/PCs.

The setting tab includes the actual contents of the GPO and lets us know what specific configurations it applies as stated before, each GPO has configurations that apply to computers only and configurations that apply to users only.

GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called **SYSVOL**, which is stored in the DC. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically. The SYSVOL share points by default to the '''C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\''' directory on each of the DCs in our network. 

Once a change is made, it could take computers up to 2 hours to sync up. You can force updates with the following command in a terminal.
```
gpupdate /force
```
