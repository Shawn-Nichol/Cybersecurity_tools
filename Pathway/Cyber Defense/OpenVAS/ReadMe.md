## Task 1 - Introduction
OpenVas is an application used to scan endpoints and web applications to identify and detect vulnerabilities. Corporations commonly use it as a mitigation solution to quickly identify gaps in their production or even development servers or applications. This is not an end-all-be-all-be-all solution, but it can help to get rid of any common vulnerabilities that may have slipped through the cracks.
